### Drones

## This Project is built with NodeJs/NextJs which are just JavaScript.

# I used MongoDB as a database which only works locally.

To test the project, NODEJS and MONGODB have to be installed in your computer.
Then run: "npm install" to install the packages I have used.

After all packages have installed, run "npm run seeder" to preload the database with some test data

You can then run in development mode by running "npm run dev" command.

You can run also in production mode by first building the project using "npm run build" command and then run "npm start"
